building pipeline:
    creatin the github repo and cloning it(add a foler experiments)
    add src folder along with the all the components(run them individually)
    inside the src 
        make a data_ingestion.py file which will see 
        preprocessing.py
        feature_engineering.py
        model_training.py
        model_evaluation.py

    add data,models,report dir to .gitignore file
    commit the changes in the github

set the DVC pipeline(without params)
    create a dvc.yaml file and stage to it 
    "dvc init" then "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation(check the "dvc dag")
    now git add,commit,push
        
setting the dvc pipeline with the params
    create a params.yaml file
    add the params setup
    do the dvc repro again to check the pipeline along with the params
    now git add,commit,push
